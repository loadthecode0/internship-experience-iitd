# Internship Season at IITD
A raw, brief summary of how my OCS internship season went, and general advice.

## Introduction
Being a CSE student, I had aimed to land an intern in either SDE or quant. After my fourth semester, I found I was not prepared for both. However, I had a good estimate of how to prepare myself, and after talking to seniors, concluded that both roles were in reach if I prepared well. I had a good CGPA and had done my courses well. So I formulated a game plan to revise previously done stuff (like DSA, Probability, Discrete Math) and learn whatever more was required. Throughout the summer, I kept in touch with batchmates who were also preparing, and we kept each other on track. Finally, after a hectic fortnight fiilled with tests and interviews, I landed a great SWE internship at [Glean Search Technlogies](www.glean.com). 

Given how difficult it was for me and my friends, I'd like to share some general advice and resources on how to prepare, what to expect and how to handle weird situations that can crop up. This is keeping in mind the general population, who, like me, found it difficult to cope in the initial phases of uncertainty and high standards of some qualifying rounds.

## A. Define your goal roles.

### 1. Talk to seniors who got internships in the roles or companies you are aiming for, or want to find out about.

You may have no idea how the roles are different from each other. Or, maybe, you can't settle on what to prepare for. It is your job to find what roles are fit for you. In general, if you like to code efficiently, cleanly and modularly, you can go for software. If you like rigourous math and would like to apply your knowledge in the financial field, you can try quant(-itative finance). You can ask relevant people about other roles like consulting and core fields. Of course, there are certain nuances, but you should be slightly inclined to one or two of these to avoid confusion nearer to the interview phase. 

For me, I am interested by both software and math, so I prepared for both.
